### Introduction

Google Web Designer is a powerful tool for creating interactive HTML5 content and ads. Its output files are HTML files containing code for the design created within the application. Opening these HTML files correctly ensures proper viewing and editing of your projects. This documentation aims to provide step-by-step guidance on how to open Google Web Designer HTML files.

### Prerequisites

- Deactivate all ad-blockers installed on your web browser, as it would interfere with viewing the project
- A web browser installed on your device (e.g. Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Safari).

#### Steps to Open Google Web Designer HTML Files:

##### Locate HTML File:
1. Navigate to the directory where the project is saved.
2. Look for the HTML file associated with the project. It typically has '.html' extension and shares the name with the project.
3. Once you've located the HTML file double-click on it. This action should automatically open the HTML file in your default web browser. (If double-clicking doesn't open the HTML file, you can right click on the file)
4. From the context menu, choose "Open with" and then select your preferred web browser from the list of available applications.
5. The HTML file should now open in the chosen web browser.


## "It's blank. Is this a joke?"
- No it's probably an error, caused by an extension running in the background that's preventing it being shown. 

## "It's still NOT showing anything."
- Try using a different browser, preferably Mozilla Firefox. An adblocker is still probably running in the background.
